Scripts to help with ubuntu as a vfx / gamedev / animation / rendering / pipeline / film environment. Giving the general toolset you need for a complete easy run.

Welcome to the repository for scripts designed to assist in enabling the usage of various VFX, animation, film, game development, pipeline, and development tools on Ubuntu. This README will guide you through the contents of this repository and how to use the provided scripts effectively.

#### Introduction
This repository aims to streamline the setup process for Ubuntu users in the fields of VFX, animation, film, game development, pipeline, and software development by providing convenient scripts to install and configure essential tools and libraries. Whether you're a professional or a hobbyist, these scripts can help you quickly get up and running with the necessary software stack.

The general concept is this. Im tired of being locked down to a single subset of Operating Systems that are "officially supported" 

With these scripts, the support from the authoring companies of software are not isnt required. How ever. this is a personal project, and each system is different. expect bugs, i will update these as issues occur and im told about it.
