## UbuntuFX by NanoVFX - Maize

Scripts to help with ubuntu as a vfx / gamedev / animation / rendering / pipeline / film environment. Giving the general toolset you need for a complete easy run.

PLEASE NOTE: this will keep the system as close to the VFX Platform standards as possible. The guidelines set out there are followed, therefore the tools you will have (provided they are available) will be the same or newer to the version you will be installing. the folder structure layout will be in years, such as 2022, 2023, 2024: (for those new to the industry) These are reference years, NOT Maya or application versions. they will be individualised inside each year and each version if there is need for a change between minor / major Linux version releases.

Welcome to the repository for scripts designed to assist in enabling the usage of various VFX, animation, film, game development, pipeline, and development tools on Ubuntu. This README will guide you through the contents of this repository and how to use the provided scripts effectively.

#### The PPA
These scripts work in conjunction with a PPA that has been set up to make it easier to find and source the software needed. 
##### ppa = comming soon

#### Introduction
This repository aims to streamline the setup process for Ubuntu users in the fields of VFX, animation, film, game development, pipeline, and software development by providing convenient scripts to install and configure essential tools and libraries. Whether you're a professional or a hobbyist, these scripts can help you quickly get up and running with the necessary software stack.

#### Supported Tools
Currently, the repository supports the installation and configuration of various tools including but not limited to:

Support for more will be added, this is a work in progress.

Note: Not all scripts install, some are simply to help production workflows and to make things easier for the creator.

The general concept is this. Im tired of being locked down to a single subset of Operating Systems that are "officially supported" 

With these scripts, the support from the authoring companies of software are not isnt required. How ever. this is a personal project, and each system is different. expect bugs, i will update these as issues occur and im told about it.
